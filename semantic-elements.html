  <h1>My Favorite Cities: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>Paris, France</h2>
  <p><em>Paris, France is the best city in the world.</em> It's beautiful and easy to get around. My favorite thing to do is wander around <strong>Canal Saint-Martin</strong>.</p>
  <h3>San Francisco</h3>
  <p>San Francisco is my favorite American city. Even though <u>it's only 7x7 miles</u>, it can feel as cosmopolitan as cities like Vancouver and Berlin.</p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>I've lucky enough to have lived in both places. I recommend people visit both. However, the cost of living makes San Francisco less appealing. If you can speak French, <q>you'll probably prefer living in Paris.</q></p>
